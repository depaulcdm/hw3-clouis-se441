Itsy Bitsy Spider

“Itsy Bitsy Spider” or “Incy Wincy Spider” is a modern nursery rhyme that is very popular among children.

The origin of this song is unknown.

It was first published in 1920, more as a song for adults in “Camp and camino in lower California” with the words “blooming, bloody” instead of “itsy bitsy”.

The actual version of “Itsy Bitsy Spider” was later printed in 1947 by the California Folklore Society in the Western Folklore collection. It appears as a nursery rhyme in 1948 in the American Folk Songs for Children a collection by Mike and Peggy Seeger and in 1955 in Maxwell Slutz Stewart’ book “The Growing Family: A Guide for Parents”.
